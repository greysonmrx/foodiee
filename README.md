## :pizza: About the project

**Foodiee** is a food delivery system built using only the JavaScript programming language. In this system, the administrator can register new restaurants, employees can register new products, customers can place orders and much more! The stack chosen to create this system was: React, to create the web pages. Express, to create the REST API. React Native, to create mobile apps. The web client, the REST API and the mobile client were developed using TypeScript and TDD.

## :rocket: Features

- **React Js** — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Native** — A lib that provides a way to create native apps for Android and iOS
- **Express** — A web framework for Node
